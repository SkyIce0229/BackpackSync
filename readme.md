# BackpackSync
This is a fabric mod that Allows you to sync player inventories, experience across multiple servers! This is accomplished using an Mysql database. In theory, most mods with nbt tags are supported.

Don't worry about creating a new world or clearing the player inventory before you can use it. This is just writing and replacing!
Feel free to use it in your own projects!
